# LoRA Lab

A simple desktop app for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with LoRA on Apple Silicon Macs. Built with Gradio for a user-friendly interface.

## Features (MVP)
- Upload and validate CSV datasets
- Select a base model from a predefined list
- Prepare for LoRA fine-tuning (training coming soon)

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app:

   ```

## Status
